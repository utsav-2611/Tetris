# Tetris
ML Project


There are two folders in this directory, each corresponding to an approach used for developing the machine playable tetris AI. 

The LSPI folder has two files tetris.py and LSPI.py. First run python LSPI.py. Use the weights obtained as a result of this algorithm in the file tetris.py. Run the file as python tetris.py. Currently these weights have been hardcoded in the file tetris.py.

The weights should be updated in the main function of tetris.py

The Genetic Algorithm has one file tetris.py. Run as python3 tetris.py.
